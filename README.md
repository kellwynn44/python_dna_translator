This code will read the DNA sequence of a gene and translate it into the corresponding amino acid sequences by using the translation table (codon_table-1.dat) to create a python amino acid dictionary. This dictionary is then used as a template to translate DNA into its amino acid sequences. The DNA sequence for the gene 
Nep3-PA is in a file named Nep3-PA.fa, which I have included in this repository. The translated amino acid values are written to a different file named translated_dna.txt. My programs results can be checked by uploading (or copy and pasting) the Nep3-PA.fa file to The European Bioinformatics Institute's online DNA translator found at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/st/emboss_transeq/.

Fun science fact: there are 64 possible codons, 61 of which code for the 20 amino acids.
