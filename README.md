# python_projects

This code will read the DNA sequence of a gene and translate it into the corresponding protein sequence by using the translation table (codon_table-1.dat) to create a python dictionary. This dictionary is then used to check triplet codon sequences and translate them into their amino acid characters. A sample DNA sequence for the gene 
Nep3-PA is in the Nep3-PA.fa file. The translated amino acid values are written to an output file (translated_dna.txt). My programs results can be checked by uploading (or copy and pasting) the Nep3-PA.fa file to The European Bioinformatics Institute's online DNA translator found at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/st/emboss_transeq/.
